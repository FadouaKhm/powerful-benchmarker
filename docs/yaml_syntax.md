# Yaml Syntax

<!-- ## Combine
The following merges the ```with_cars196``` config file into the ```default``` config file, in the ```config_general``` category.
```
python run.py --experiment_name test1 --config_general [default, with_cars196]
```
This is convenient when you want to change a few settings (specified in ```with_cars196```), and keep all the other options unchanged (specified in ```default```). You can specify any number of config files to merge, and they get loaded and merged in the order that you specify.
